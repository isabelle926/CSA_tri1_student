## Plans for this trimester
This trimester, I'll be joining another team rather than work on the job finding website from last trimester. [Here](https://john-scc.github.io/jcc_frontend/2024/03/07/planning_blog.html) is the blog which contains details about our plans for group organization this trimester. I'll be primarily working on backend this trimester, and our subgroup will be focused on data science as well as implementing features from previous projects.
