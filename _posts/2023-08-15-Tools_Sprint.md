### I love to code code code with my tools!
1. VSCode - a very useful IDE for editing my code! I can connect Github to VSCode, which is very helpful. : ) 
2. Homebrew - brew is a very poewerful installer that is used to manage MacOS packages! friendship ended with pip, brew is my bestie now > : )
3. Jupyter Notebook - jupyter is super useful for cleaning data, visualization, etc. mainly stuff involved in ml : ) 
4. Docker - cool container for code and the things it needs to run : ) 
5. Github - conspicuously cool code collaboration tool that can keep track of everything and organize code
